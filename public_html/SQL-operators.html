        <h1>SQL Operators</h1>
        <ul><li>An operator is a reserved word or a character used primarily in an SQL statement's WHERE clause to perform operation(s), such as comparisons and arithmetic operations.</li>
            <li>These Operators are used to specify conditions in an SQL statement and to serve as conjunctions for multiple conditions in a statement.
