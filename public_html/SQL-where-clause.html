        <h1>Where Clause</h1>
        <ul><li>The SQL WHERE clause is used to specify a condition while fetching the data from a single table or by joining with multiple tables</li>
            <li>If the given condition is satisfied, then only it returns a specific value from the table</li>
            <li>You should use the WHERE clause to filter the records and fetching only the necessary records</li>
            <li>The WHERE clause is not only used in the SELECT statement, but it also used in the UPDATE, DELETE Statements</li>
        </ul>
