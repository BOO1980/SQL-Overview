        <h3>SQL Queries</h3>
        <ul><li>The same query that runs on a mobile device can run on the largest grid computer, taking advantage of all available hardware with no changes to the query</li>
            <li>When used for querying SQL is a descriptive language rather than a procedural language.  It describes what needs to be done</li>
            <li>The  SQL engine optimises the code for the particular data, hardware and database layout</li>
        </ul>
    </body>
