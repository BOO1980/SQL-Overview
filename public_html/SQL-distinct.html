        <h1>SQL Distinct Keyword</h1>
                <ul><li>
            The SQL DISTINCT keyword is used in conjunction with the SELECT statement to eliminate all the duplicate records and fetching only unique records.
            </li>
            <li>There may be a situation when you have multiple duplicate records in a table. While fetching such records, it makes more sense to fetch only those unique records instead of fetching duplicate records.</li></ul>
    </body>
