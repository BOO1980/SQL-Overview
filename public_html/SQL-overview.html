                <ul><li>
                        Allow users to access data in relational database management systems
                    </li>
                    <li>Allow users to describe data</li>
                    <li>Allow users to define the data in a database and manipulate that data</li>
                    <li>Allows to embed within other languages using SQL modules, libraries & pre-compilers </li>
                    <li>Allows users to create and drop databases and tables</li>
                    <li>Allows users to create view, stored procedures, functions in a database</li>
