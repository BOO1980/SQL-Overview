        <h1>SQL Overview</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>SQL is a database computer language designed for the retrieval and management of data in a relational database</li>
            <li>SQL stands for Structured Query Language</li>
            <li>SQL was designed to work on structured data</li>
            <li>SQL is a domain-specific language</li>
            <li>SQL is also for relational data stream management system</li>
            <li>SQL can also be pronounced as sequel</li>
            <li>SQL is useful when handling structured data where there are relations between different entities/variables of the data</li>
            <li>SQL introduced the concept of accessing many records with one single command</li>
            <li>SQL eliminates the need to specify how to reach a record with or without an index </li>
            <li>SQL has become a requirement for most data science jobs that include: data analyst, BI Development, Programmer and Database programmer</li>
            <li>SQL can be used with all application languages like PHP and Java</li>
            <li>You can create own data visualisations by integrating SQL in their application</li>
            <li>Data can be retrieved from a database and converted into XML and JSON formats</li>
            <li>SQL can be used in web services or APIs</li>
            <li>SQL Includes database creation, deletion, fetching rows, modifying rows etc</li>
            <li>SQL is popular as it offers the following advantages
                <ul><li>
                        Allow users to access data in relational database management systems
                    </li>
                    <li>Allow users to describe data</li>
                    <li>Allow users to define the data in a database and manipulate that data</li>
                    <li>Allows to embed within other languages using SQL modules, libraries & pre-compilers </li>
                    <li>Allows users to create and drop databases and tables</li>
                    <li>Allows users to create view, stored procedures, functions in a database</li>
                    <li>Allow users to set permissions on tables, procedures and views</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Many DBMS vendors have extended their support for SQL by adding statements or instructions to the language, which provide additional functionality</li>
            <li>SQL is governed by the ANSI standards committee</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Database Overview</h1>
        <ul>    <li>You use databases all the time<ul>
                    <li>When you use the Internet search site</li>
                    <li>When you log into a network you are validating your name and password against a database</li>
                    <li>Even when you use an ATM card at a cash machine you are using database for PIN number verification and balance checking</li>
                </ul></li>
            <li>A database is a collection of data stored in some organised fashion</li>
            <li>Database software is actually called the Database Management System (DBMS)</li>
            <li>A database is a container created and manipulated via the DBMS</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>RDBMS</h1>
        <ul><li>RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System
            </li>
            <li>RDBMS is the basis for SQL and for all modern database systems like MS SQL Server, IBM DB2, Oracle, MySQL and Microsoft Access</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Tables</h1>
        <ul><li>The data is an RDBMS is stored in database objects which as called as tables
            </li>
            <li>A table is a structured file that can store data of a specific type</li>
            <li>A table is one type of data or one list</li>
            <li>Every table in a database has a name that identifies it.  That name must be always unique</li>
            <li>What makes a table name unique is a combination of the database name and table name</li>
            <li>You cannot use the same table name twice in the same database</li>
            <li>You can reuse table names in different databases</li>
            <li>Tables have characteristics and properties that define how data is stored in them, information includes<ul><li>
                        What data is to be stored</li>
                    <li>How the table is broke up</li>
                    <li>How individual pieces of information are named</li></ul>

            </li>
            <li>Schema is Information about a database, the table layout and its properties</li>
            <li>Schema's are used to describe specific tables within a database, as well as entire database and relationships between tables</li>
            <li>The Table is a collection of related data entries and its consists of numerous columns and rows</li>
            <li>A table is the most common and simplest form of data storage in a relational database.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Fields</h1>
        <ul><li>
                Every table is broken up into smaller entities called fields
            </li>
            <li>A field is a column in a table that is designed to maintain specific information in every record in the table</li></ul>
        <h1>Record or a Row</h1>
        <ul><li>A record is also called a row of data</li>
            <li>A record is each individual entry that exists in a table</li>
            <li>A record is a horizontal entity in a table</li>
            <li>Data in a table is stored in rows</li>
            <li>Each record is stored in its own row</li></ul>
        <img src="images/sql-field.png" alt="sql-field"/>
        <h1>Columns</h1>
        <ul><li>A column is a vertical entity in a table that contains all information associated with a specific field in a table</li>
            <li>Tables are made up of one or more columns</li>
            <li>Column is a single field in a table</li>
            <li>It is extremely important to break data into multiple columns correctly.  By doing this makes it possible to sort and filter data</li>
            <li>Each column in the database has an associated datatype, which defines what type of data the column can contain</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Primary Keys</h1>
        <ul><li>Every row in a table should have some column that uniquely identifies it, this is called a primary key</li>
            <li>A primary key is used to refer to a specific row</li>
            <li>Without a primary key, updating or deleting specific rows in a table becomes extremely difficult</li>
            <li>Every row must have a primary key value</li>
            <li>No two rows can have the same primary key value</li>
            <li>Values in primary key columns should never be modified or updated</li>
            <li>Primary keys should never be reused; i.e. if a row is deleted from a table</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>NULL Value</h1>
        <ul><li>A NULL value in a table is a value in a field that appears to be blank</li>
            <li>A NULL value means no value</li></ul>
