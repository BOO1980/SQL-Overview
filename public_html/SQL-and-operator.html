        <h1>SQL AND & OR Operator</h1>
        <ul><li>The SQL AND & OR operators are used to combine multiple conditions to narrow data in an SQL statement. These two operators are called as the conjunctive operators.</li>
            <li>These operators provide a means to make multiple comparisons with different operators in the same SQL statement.</li>
            <li>The AND operator allows the existence of multiple conditions in an SQL statement's WHERE clause.</li>
            <li>You can combine N number of conditions using the AND operator. For an action to be taken by the SQL statement, whether it be a transaction or a query, all conditions separated by the AND must be TRUE.</li>
            <li>The OR operator is used to combine multiple conditions in an SQL statement's WHERE clause.</li>
            <li>You can combine N number of conditions using the OR operator. For an action to be taken by the SQL statement, whether it be a transaction or query, the only any ONE of the conditions separated by the OR must be TRUE.</li>
        </ul>
