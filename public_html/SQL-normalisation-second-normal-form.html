        <h1>Third Normal Form</h1>
        <ul><li>
                A table is in a third normal form when the following conditions are met âˆ’
                <ul><li>It is in second normal form.</li>
                    <li>All non-primary fields are dependent on the primary key.</li>
                </ul></li>
                <li>The advantages of removing transitive dependencies is that the amount of data duplication is reduced and therefore your database becomes smaller.</li>
                <li>Another advantage is data integrity</li>
        </ul>
