        <h1>SQL Order By</h1>
                <ul><li> The SQL ORDER BY clause is used to sort the data in ascending or descending order, based on one or more columns. Some databases sort the query results in an ascending order by default. </li>
                    <li>You can use more than one column in the ORDER BY clause. Make sure whatever column you are using to sort that column should be in the column-list.</li></ul>
